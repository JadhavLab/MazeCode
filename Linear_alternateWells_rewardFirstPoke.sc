% PROGRAM NAME: 	LINEAR TRACK ALTERNATION
% AUTHOR: 			MCZ
% DESCRIPTION:
%						This program delivers reward from each reward well (on a linear track) when the beam is broken, and the animal successfully alternates from one well to the other. Reward delivery ceases after 1sec.

%CONSTANTS

int deliverPeriod= 500   % how long to deliver the reward

%VARIABLES

int count= 0                % blink count
int lastWell= 0             % last well
int currWell= 0            % current well
int rewardWell= 0       % reward well
int nowRewarding = 0 % keep track of reward being dispensed

		do in deliverPeriod % NOTE: USING A VARIABLE HERE WORKS
			portout[rewardWell]=0 % reset reward
			nowRewarding=0 % no longer rewarding
		end
