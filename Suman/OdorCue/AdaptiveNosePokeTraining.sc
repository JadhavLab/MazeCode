% PROGRAM NAME: Adaptive Nose Poke Training
% AUTHOR: Suman K. Guha
% DESCRIPTION: This program trains animals to nose poke from scratch and get to a specific duration to get a reward using a step-wise adaptive increment/decrement. The intention is to have a very fast cue which indicates reward dispension and to get from zero to a nose poke trained animal very fast.

% REGIME:
% A single epoch consists of a 10 min sleep box; 30 min of adaptive nose-pokeâ€“reward training; and another 10 mins of sleep box. Total epoch duration = 50 min.
