% PROGRAM NAME: LINEAR TRACK ROUNDS OF 10
% AUTHOR: Suman K. Guha
% DESCRIPTION: This program delivers reward from each reward well (on a linear track) when the beam is broken, and the animal successfully goes to the well that  has the LED on â€” each well has an LED separately wired to the ECU. After successful 10 trials, the reward well alternates. After that, Each epoch has two trials of 10 each. After that randomize the LED and reward dispension pattern to make sure direction is not being associated, rather just the LED with food.

% FUNCTIONS SECTION
% ------------------------------------------------------------
% this function switches active well

% this function dispenses reward
function 2

  portout[activePump] = 1 % deliver reward
  do in rewardDeliveryDuration

  end
  successCounter = successCounter + 1
  disp('Times Rewarded:')

end;

% this function checks and verifies the choice made by the subject. If correct choice, then triggers the function to dispense reward
function 3
  if (currentWell == activeWell) do
    disp('Correct choice')
    rewardWell == currentWell
    trigger(2)
  else do
    disp('Wrong choice')
  end;

% this function asks the operator to end the trial
function 4
  disp('END OF TRIAL')
  disp('PRESS END TRIAL BUTTON')
end;
